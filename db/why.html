Koblo brings buying, remixing and selling music online to the next level. 

Koblo is not just another website for music-lovers. Its a completely new online music organism like never seen before. Koblo is a marketplace where users can buy music as multi-tracks and share or sell it. When you buy music from Koblo, you get not only the opportunity to buy all tracks as a cohesive whole, but also to buy each instrument/sound individually. The different tracks can then be used as a basis for creating a new track or mixing it with another.

Koblo also gives its users the possibility to upload their own music for other users to buy, which creates a unique opportunity for sharing and working with music. Koblo appeals to musicians, producers, DJs and everyone else with an interest in music. 

Koblo is created from the vision of a novel platform for selling, buying and sharing multi-track recordings, which creates a synergistic effect, resulting in great musical innovations. The philosophy is that everyone should be able to use it and that you get to listen and tweak before you buy. Each Koblo user can listen to and mix multi-tracks directly in the browser using Koblo Mini Studio before buying and downloading any tracks.

Artists decide the price of their music and the profit is shared between the artist and Koblo. The same applies when Koblo users sell remixes of original music, but with the addition that the re-mixer also gets a percentage.

Koblos profit performance is therefore based on established artists, amateurs and ordinary users who buy and sell music through Koblo. 

Nephew, Alphabeat, and Spleen United are only a few in a long list of established artists who have shown interest in Koblo and have declared themselves as part of the project.
